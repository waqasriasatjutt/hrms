POS Hide Out-of-Stock Products for Odoo 18

This module enhances the Point of Sale (POS) interface by:

- Fetching the current stock quantity (qty_available) for all products from the backend.
- Filtering out products that have zero stock when the 'Hide Out-of-Stock Products' setting is enabled in the POS configuration.
- Ensuring the POS product list only displays available products to cashiers, improving usability and reducing errors.
- Includes detailed debug logging for:
    * Total products loaded
    * Products hidden due to zero stock
    * Products after filtering
    * Final products displayed after exclusions

This module works without modifying any core POS files and leverages Odoo 18's reactive product rendering.
