    "summary": "Restrict POS order deletion based on user settings.",
    "description": """
        This module adds an extra layer of control to the Point of Sale by restricting the ability to delete POS orders. 
        A new boolean option is added in the User configuration. When enabled for a user, the delete option will be hidden 
        in the POS Orders screen, preventing the user from deleting any POS order.
    
        Key Features:
        - Adds a boolean field in User settings to control POS order delete access.
        - If the restriction is enabled, the user cannot view the delete icon in POS Orders.
        - Users with restricted access are completely blocked from deleting POS orders.
        - Ensures better data security and prevents accidental or unauthorized deletions.
